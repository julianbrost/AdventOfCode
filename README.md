# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code].

Maybe you find some of this useful, but keep in mind that the code was written
to work once and never be touched again.  Also, this is more of a playground
for me and it may also contain code in languages that I'm not very familiar
with.
